## Introduction

OSM2GPD is a Python package that provides a moderately memory-efficient parser for loading OpenStreetMap (OSM) data in its native protobuf format into a sparse GeoPandas DataFrame. This package aims to help users work with large OSM datasets while minimizing memory usage and providing a convenient interface for data manipulation.
